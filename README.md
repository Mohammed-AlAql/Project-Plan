# Project Plan for Legend Group
We decided to work on robotic arm project, so we have done the project sheet together by making our first meeting on Tuesday at 8:30 , then our Legend engineers wrote the distribution of task for each course and determine the time line, and we make sure to being in the safe side as we can, and that's what we get!
